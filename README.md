# Deep Learning Projects

Use Tensorflow 2.0 to implement different deep learning applications.

The goal of this repo is to provide some insights about how to use tf 2.0.

## Roadmap
- Reinforcement Learning - Deep Q-Network (low dimensional input)
- Reinforcement Learning - Deep Q-Network (high dimensional input)
- Natural Language Processing - A Transformer Chatbot
- Reinforcement Learning - Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
